# Reverse Collatz Conjecture Mind Map

This project explores the Collatz conjecture by working backward from the number 1. It generates a tree-like "mind map" of all the numbers that lead to 1, revealing the branching structure of the reversed sequences.

## Project Overview

The standard Collatz conjecture starts with a positive integer `n` and repeatedly applies two rules:
- If `n` is even, the next term is `n / 2`.
- If `n` is odd, the next term is `3n + 1`.

This project does the reverse:
- If a number `m` is even, its predecessor could be `m / 2` (since `(m/2) * 2 = m`).
- If a number `m` can be expressed as `3n + 1`, its predecessor could be `n = (m - 1) / 3`.

By starting at `1` and applying these reverse rules, we can generate a tree of all numbers that eventually lead to `1`.

## File Descriptions

- **`collatz_mindmap.py`**: This is the primary data generation script. It builds the reverse Collatz tree starting from `1` up to a specified depth. It produces a JSON file that represents this tree structure.

- **`visualize_mindmap.py`**: This script takes the JSON data generated by the first script and uses the Graphviz library to create a visually appealing PNG image of the mind map.

- **`main.py`**: The original script for analyzing Collatz sequences, likely used to generate the initial data in the `advanced_analysis` and `graphs` directories.

- **`collatz_mindmap.json`**: An intermediate data file containing the mind map structure in a hierarchical format. This file is read by `visualize_mindmap.py`.

- **`graphs/collatz_mindmap_visualization.png`**: The final output image of the mind map.

## Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, you need to have the following installed:

1.  **Python 3**: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2.  **Graphviz Software**: This is a separate program required for rendering the graph.
    -   **Download**: [https://graphviz.org/download/](https://graphviz.org/download/)
    -   **Important**: During installation, ensure you add Graphviz to your system's PATH environment variable. The installer usually provides a checkbox for this.

3.  **Python `graphviz` Library**: Install this using pip after installing the Graphviz software.
    ```sh
    pip install graphviz
    ```

## How to Use

Follow these steps to generate and view the mind map:

### Step 1: Generate the Mind Map Data

Run the `collatz_mindmap.py` script. This will create the `collatz_mindmap.json` file.

```sh
python collatz_mindmap.py
```

### Step 2: Create the Visualization

Next, run the `visualize_mindmap.py` script. This reads the JSON file and creates the PNG image.

```sh
python visualize_mindmap.py
```

The final image will be saved as `graphs/collatz_mindmap_visualization.png`.

## Customizing the Mind Map

To generate a larger or smaller mind map, you can change the search depth.

1.  Open the `collatz_mindmap.py` file in a text editor.
2.  Find the line `MAX_DEPTH = 8` near the end of the file.
3.  Change the number `8` to a higher value (e.g., `10`, `12`) for a larger tree, or a lower value for a smaller one.
4.  Save the file.
5.  **Re-run both scripts** as described in the "How to Use" section to see your changes.
